## Nonna's Zeppole

My notes from Christmas eve 2017:

9 tazze water

Some orange

Lemon skin

Some olive oil (a little bit)

Salt

A few spoonfuls of sugar 

7 tazze farina 

Bring to boil then take off heat, add in flour and mix

Add eggs. We used about 16. 

Nonna had another batch already made with 7 tazze aqua, 5 tazze farina and 8 eggs then we mixed them together as we added the eggs to the big batch.
